LocalFlow is a local-first computer vision platform designed for rapid dataset curation and model testing. Built for the modern, efficiently-lazy engineer, it replaces the manual clicking of the pre-corona era—where you'd hire a junior to draw thousands of boxes—with local multimodal models (VLMs) that act as virtual interns. It’s for the developer who’d rather write a prompt once than click a mouse five thousand times; high-performance vision orchestration that works locally, privately, and without the need for coffee breaks or LinkedIn endorsements.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

- **Intelligent Auto-Labeling**: Harness local VLMs (LLaVA, Moondream) to pre-annotate images via natural language prompts.
- **Production Exports**: Native support for **YOLOv8** and **YOLOv11** dataset structures (`images/labels` + `data.yaml`).
- **Inference Playground**: Compare dual-inference results from Ollama or LM Studio side-by-side.
- **Privacy Native**: 100% local. Your data stays on your machine, away from the cloud.

## 🚀 Native Integration

LocalFlow communicates directly with your local AI stack via OpenAI-compatible endpoints:
- **Ollama**: `http://localhost:11434`
- **LM Studio**: `http://localhost:1234`
- **Filesystem API**: Native directory selection for direct local exports.

## 🛠️ How to Run

The easiest way to start both the backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) is using the included script:

```bash
./start.sh
```

**Manual Startup:**

1. **Backend** (Port 8000):
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

2. **Frontend** (Port 3000):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
